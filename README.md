# Speed vs. Speed to Market
## A talk about approaching web performance proactively.
by [Jeremy Wagner](https://jeremywagner.me) ([@malchata](https://twitter.com/malchata))

Yet another one of my talks, except this one is on web performance, and what you can do to be a performance advocate before sites get into prod (as well as some tips for what to do when things are slow in prod).

If you want to run this talk locally, just clone this repo, `cd` into its directory, and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then spin up the local web server by typing `npm run presentation` and point your browser to http://localhost:8080.
