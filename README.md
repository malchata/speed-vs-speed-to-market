# Speed vs. Speed to Market
## A talk about being proactive about web performance.
by [Jeremy Wagner](https://jeremywagner.me) ([@malchata](https://twitter.com/malchata))

Yet another one of my talks, except this one is on web performance, and what you can do to be a performance advocate before sites get into prod (as well as what you can do if you have slow sites in production).

If you want to run this talk locally, just clone this repo and spin up the little server by typing `node http.js` and a local server will spin up at http://localhost:8080.
